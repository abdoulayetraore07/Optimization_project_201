# Non-linear Optimization Project Using SQP method

## 📌 Description
This project implements a **Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)** algorithm to solve non-linear optimization problems. The implementation is done in Python with a focus on mathematical rigor and computational efficiency.

The SQP algorithm is particularly effective for constrained optimization problems where both the objective function and constraints are non-linear.
